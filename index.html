Who thought we could get this far, as we started on a small village? We were climbing up on the classifications and celebrating promotions back to 1970 because we were the best of the best, and the same applied for many years. We had many football stars in our team, such as Ronaldo, Leo Messi, Neymar and Kun Agüero, all of them with quite a few Golden Balls.</p>
                <p class="text-muted text-justify"> What matters is not  we have reached this far because of you. We have won a lot of champions because of you and we have won many promotions and prices because of you.</p>

We have first-hand information that the current president and his management team have been taking money out of our beloved club, such as making unacknowledged payments to player managers, movements in accounts located in tax havens and other illegal irregularities.</p>
